# SaveLngGame

🎮 A fun, interactive word-guessing game built with React!

SaveLngGame challenges players to guess letters of a hidden word one-by-one. It's a test of logic, vocabulary, and strategy. Just like Hangman – but built modern using React and JavaScript.

## 🧠 How to Play

- A hidden word is chosen randomly.
- You guess the word one letter at a time.
- Correct letters are revealed in their correct positions.
- Incorrect guesses may be tracked.
- The game ends when:
  - All letters are guessed (**Win!**)
  - You run out of allowed wrong guesses (**Game Over!**)
- Restart the Game
